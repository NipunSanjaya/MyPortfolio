1
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,391
Hold on, let me...

2
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,856
- Let me just...
- I dropped the horse.

3
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,065
Hold on.

4
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,360
There. Look.

5
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,529
Ta-da! See?

6
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,697
Is it broken?

7
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,783
No, look. Daddy fixed it. No, wait.

8
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:17,411
I'll give it to you
when you tell me where we are first.

9
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,830
-Dad's dad's house.
-That's right.

10
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,040
This was Grandpa's house.

11
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,625
Here, you want the camera?

12
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:24,918
Here, take it.

13
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:27,296
No. Owie!

14
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,256
No, no, no, show me the playroom.

15
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,343
Wait, show your toys.

16
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:40,225
Oh, it's okay, Caesar.

17
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,685
Aw.

18
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,605
I think Little Caesar's tired out
from the drive. Aren't you, buddy?

19
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:47,774
James?
Why aren't there any curtains upstairs?

20
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:50,903
Because, babe, we're in the middle
of nowhere and no one's watching.

21
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:52,070
Say hi, Mommy.

22
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:53,780
Hi, Junebug.

23
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,866
Wait a minute,
I thought this was broken.

24
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,828
No, baby, please be careful.
I just don't want it to break again.

25
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:01,914
-Daddy fixed it.
-Yeah.

26
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:04,124
We just wanna make sure
that we don't break it again.

27
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,461
Well, then I'm just gonna
fix it again, aren't I?

28
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,794
What's that?

29
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,673
- James.
- It's just the altitude. I'm fine.

30
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,717
Why is your nose bleeding?

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,594
-Daddy's fine.
-Are you okay?

32
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,763
<i>I just heard the news.</i>

33
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,474
<i>Uh, I can't imagine
what you must be going through.</i>

34
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:06,228
<i>We really hate to see you go,
but I get it. You need a fresh start.</i>

35
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,647
<i>I really had no idea
what you were going through.</i>

36
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,191
<i>Anyway, I'm so sorry.</i>

37
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:13,485
<i>Call or text, or whatever works.</i>

38
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,530
<i>I know you are dealing
with a lot right now.</i>

39
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:21,535
<i>We're gonna miss you a lot.
But you two are gonna get through this.</i>

40
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,371
<i>I'm here for you.
Someday she'll understand.</i>

41
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:45,309
Frightening developments this morning
as a green Toyota Camry--

42
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,190
<i>A recovery operation is
currently underway, but it's unclear--</i>

43
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:59,072
<i>A shocking development today,
as a vehicle belonging to Ms. Kim</i>

44
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:02,075
<i>was found dumped in a Bay Area lake.
The lead detective--</i>

45

Here.

<i>...Margot's father, David Kim.</i>

47
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,918
<i>They found Ms. Kim's keychain
near the lake earlier this morning.</i>

48
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:05,055
Siri, call June.

49
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,515
-Oh, my gosh.
-Mom?

50
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,058
Siri, please call Junebug.

51
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,811
Mom, you're already on the phone.
This is FaceTime.

52
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,813
Well-- Oh, gosh.

53
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,774
Can you please do me a favor
and clear your voicemail?

54
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,442
I've been trying to leave you messages.

55
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,027
Well, they're probably all from you.

56
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,697
You know you don't have to use Siri
for literally everything, right?

57
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,783
Listen, I am running late and I need you
to write a couple of things down.

58
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:28,954
The car keys are gonna be in
the top drawer in the kitchen, and Kevin--

59
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,832
I just said write it down.
You're not writing it down.

60
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,461
Kevin forwarded you the itinerary.

61
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,923
No alcohol,
do not open the door for strangers.

62
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:43,510
And keep your location service turned on

63
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:47,139
the entire time I'm away,
do you understand?

64
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,348
No fun. Got it.

65
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:52,686
Uh, what about for like,
you know, food or whatever?

66
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,231
I left a key with Heather.
Just call her if you need anything.

67
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:59,401
-No. Mom, I don't need Heather.
-What do you mean, "No"?

68
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,486
I am 18. I don't need a babysitter.

69
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,947
I don't care if you're 18, okay?

70
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,490
So you pick Heather, of all people?

71
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,869
You do not understand the sacrifices
I made to give you the life that you have.

72
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,579
Mom, you're being so dramatic.

73
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,789
-Junebug, if you'd--
-Stop calling me that!

74
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,256
I just need to know that you're safe
when I'm away.

75
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:28,013
All right, Kevin's gonna be there
any minute to call the Uber.

76
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,767
I also just deposited some money
into your account for emergencies.

77
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,101
Understand?

78
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,396
What's the money for?

79
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,815
Emergencies.

Whoa.

84
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,912
That cat just won't come around.

85
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,790
How's the old, uh, computer running?

86
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,960
Oh, yeah. It's a little faster. Thanks.

Uh...

90
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,925
It's a Colombian thing.
I'm working on my Spanish.

91
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,760
Cool.

92
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:11,890

00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,488
Look.

97
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:30,117

98
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:33,787
I don't know, the new guy to you.

99
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,124
But I love your mom.

100
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:42,838
And I know I planned this
for just me and her,

101
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,133
but it's for a very special reason.

102
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,426
-Kev?
-So before we--

103
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,927
-Hey.
-Hey.

What's goin' on?

105
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,182
June and I were just chatting.

106
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:55,058
Oh, okay. Did you call the Uber?

107
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,852
Two minutes away. What?

108
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,729
Do you wanna take the bags down?

109
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,522
It takes 30 seconds to wheel--

110
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:01,690
I know, but I wanna talk...

111
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,400
Okay, all right, I'll see you out there.

112
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,610

00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:15,579

like I'm hard on you.

115
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,586

176
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,262
<i>Hey, you ready for tonight?</i>

177
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,390
I guess.

178
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,060
<i>You, uh... You doing okay?</i>

179
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:09,479
Yeah.

180
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:12,691
Yeah, I'm fine.

181
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,121
- Whoa, June.
- I'm fine.

182
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,666
- Calm down. Sit down.
- I'm fine!

183
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:39,384
Yo, June, you okay?

184
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:42,012
Anybody seen my smartwatch?
It's square with--

185
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,848
Okay. It's all right.
All right, listen to me.

186
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,934
You're all right.
Tia, can you get the cup?

187
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,894
-All right, let's go. You're done.
-I'm sorry.

188
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,647
Okay, June, okay.

189
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,284
I think Little Caesar's tired out
from the drive. Aren't you, buddy?

190
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:07,496
James?
Why aren't there any curtains upstairs?

191
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:10,958
Because, babe, we're in the middle
of nowhere and no one's watching.

192
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,585
Hi, Junebug.

193
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:15,504
Wait a minute,
I thought this was broken.

194
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:19,591
No, baby, please be careful.
I just don't want it to break again.

195
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:21,593
-Daddy fixed it.
-Yeah.

196
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:23,804
We just wanna make sure
that we don't break it again.

197
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,014
Well, then I'm just gonna fix it again.

198
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,260
Oh, shit.

199
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:20,230
<i>Hi, this is Grace Allen.
Please leave a message.</i>

200
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:21,815
Mom?

201
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,694
<i>Where are you guys?
I've been standing here forever.</i>

202
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,488
<i>Let me know when you get this.</i>

203
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:32,242
<i>See you in a sec. Bye.</i>

204
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,069
Hi. I'm calling about a guest you had,

205
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:10,405
seeing if they extended their stay.

206
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,661
Um...

207
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:19,164
I'm sorry.
Uh, does anyone speak English?

208
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:21,916
<i>No, I'm sorry.</i>

209
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,838
Knew I shouldn't have dropped Spanish.

210
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,381
Um...

211
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:36,557
<i> Nombre?</i>

212
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,142
Um, it's Lin. It's spelled L-I--

213
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,686
<i>Oh, </i>sí, Kevin Lin.

214
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,188
Yeah. That's him. Uh...

215
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,194
Um...

216
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,154
Uh...

217
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,408
<i>¿Qué?</i>

218
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,125
Wait, what?

219
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:05,544
Um...

220
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:19,892
What?

221
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:24,104
- <i>Hello?
</i>-Um...

222
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:32,863
<i>No. </i>

223
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,281
Okay. Uh...

224
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:37,284
Uh...

225
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:38,744
Cameras.

226
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:43,290
Um...

227
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:49,505
<i>"En persona."</i>

228
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:51,131
I can't go in person.

229
00:18:57,763 --> 00:18:59,431
The footage overwrites.

230
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:02,059
Uh... <i>Cuándo?</i>

231
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,566
Okay. Uh...

232
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,568
<i>Gracias.</i>

233
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:31,296
<i>Yes, ma'am.
And no one knows where they went.</i>

234
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:36,176
I understand. Yes. Thank you.

235
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:39,763
So is the embassy doing something?

236
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:41,682
No, they're already closed.

237
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,934
That was a duty officer.
She said to fill out a report,

238
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,562
and somebody would call us tomorrow
when the embassy opens.

239
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:48,981
And what about the footage?
Won't that be too late?

240
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,483
I know.

241
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:56,238
I'll make some more calls.
Somebody's gotta be open 24/7.

242
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:01,201
So I'll just fill out this form and--

243
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:02,578
Don't worry.

244
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:04,580
I'm gonna come by first thing
tomorrow morning

245
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:05,914
when the embassy opens, okay?

246
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:07,833
We're gonna figure this out.

247
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,293
Okay. Yeah.

248
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:11,670
Thanks, Heather.

249
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,698
<i>Good morning. This is
Assistant Legal Attaché Elijah Park.</i>

250
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:42,117
<i>- Am I speaking with Ms. Allen?

251
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,913
<i>-Hello?
</i>-Hi. Hi. Hello?

252
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:49,833
<i>Hi there. This is Elijah Park. I'm calling
from the U.S. Embassy in Colombia.</i>

253
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:52,127
I thought you guys opened
an hour ago.

254
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:55,047
<i>Sorry, I was on with Ms. Damore.</i>

255
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:59,134
<i>She mentioned you wanted to speak with me
about some footage?</i>

256
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:02,846
Yes. Um, the security footage,
I put it all in the report.

257
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:06,433
<i>I'll take a look.
Now, I'm here in Colombia,</i>

258
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:09,228
<i>so I'll be acting as liaison
between you and the local police.</i>

259
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:10,646
Did you not get my report?

260
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:14,316
<i>Um... doesn't appear so.</i>

261
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:17,402
Great. Okay, well,
the hotel has security footage,

262
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:18,946
but it constantly overwrites.

263
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:22,991
So we have about six hours
until it's gone,

264
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:25,994
so can you please send an agent over?

265
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:27,538
<i>I'll do my best.</i>

266
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:33,335
<i>But keep in mind, the FBI doesn't have
jurisdiction to investigate in Colombia.</i>

267
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:37,589
<i>So it may take some time
while we work with local authorities.</i>

268
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:39,883
Great.

269
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,094
<i>Now, listen,
what's even more helpful to us</i>

270
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:45,138
<i>is any information
you can tell me about your mom.</i>

271
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:48,475
<i>Did she say or do anything unusual
before she went missing?</i>

272
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,103
<i>Could be a text, uh... a voicemail.</i>

273
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:53,564
No, not really.

274
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:54,773
<i>Okay. That's okay.</i>

275
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:58,402
<i>Um... and do you have access
to anything we could use to geolocate?</i>

276
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:01,071
<i>Her Gmail, iCloud?</i>

277
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,031
Wait. Maybe...

278
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:15,210
<i>Listen, we can only use evidence from
accounts that you have legal access to.</i>

279
00:22:15,294 --> 00:22:17,379
<i>Otherwise nothing we learn
will be admissible in court.</i>

280
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,256
I think I might have something.

281
00:22:23,302 --> 00:22:24,469
Come on.

282
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,371
Never mind. Sorry, I don't have anything.

283
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:52,623
<i>That's okay.</i>

284
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:56,835
<i>I know you're 18, but do you have
relatives that could come stay with you?</i>

285
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:59,671
No. Um, it's just me and my mom.

286
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:01,924
Heather is probably gonna stop by.

287
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:05,177
You are going to get that footage,
though, right?

288
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,889
<i>If you get that form in, I'll make sure
it gets to the right hands. Okay?</i>

289
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:11,225
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

290
00:25:15,641 --> 00:25:17,184
Hi. Hello?

291
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:21,522
Hi. Um...

292
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:23,565
I think your sound is off.

293
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:29,738
Oh, hi. Yes, yes. Hi, Javier.

294
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:38,622
Uh... signal okay now?

295
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,290
The signal is great. I need you--

296
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:41,667
You are from where?

297
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,460
I'm from Los Angeles. I need--

298
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:44,503
Hollywood!

299
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:46,171
Van Nuys.

300
00:25:46,255 --> 00:25:49,883
I need you to go to this hotel
and ask for their security footage.

301
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:51,635
I'm tryna find someone.

302
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:54,263
I don't understand. "Tryna find."

303
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:55,848
She's missing.

304
00:25:58,851 --> 00:25:59,935
How long?

305
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:01,395
Like 36 hours.

306
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:05,524
And I need someone to get to the hotel
and get the footage before it's erased

307
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:07,985
so we can see
when she and her boyfriend left.

308
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:09,653
<i>La policía</i> will not check?

309
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:14,074
No. No, I mean, they said they would try,
but they can't even investigate directly.

310
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:15,868
So I need your help.

311
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:17,536
<i>Ah, lo siento, pero...</i>

312
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,414
I'm only services.
Cleaning, electric, you know.

313
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,625
Please. Please, it's my mom.

314
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,337
Please.

315
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:32,801
You make me think of my son.

316
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:34,553
Never taking no for an answer.

317
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:45,939
Okay. Okay.

318
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:47,441
Oh, man, thank you so much.

319
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:49,359
Oh, June. Interesting thing.

320
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:52,905
Did you know that your phones
are always tracking you?

321
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,824
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

322
00:26:55,908 --> 00:26:58,827
But I can't get into her accounts
even if I wanted to.

323
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:00,120
And did you try his?

324
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:02,372
What?

325
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:04,875
You said she's traveling
with her boyfriend.

326
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:07,211
So if you can't find hers, maybe...

327
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:08,337
Right.

328
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:15,219
I can find him.

329
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:25,020
- Yo.
- Hey, Vee.

330
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:27,356
Thanks for coming by.
Heather never showed up.

331
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:29,399
Of course. This is so crazy.

332
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:33,529
Uh, hey, I think Caesar's
eating your smartwatch.

333
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:35,739
What? I don't have a smartwatch.

334
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:39,868
Anyway, does Kevin give you
same-password-for-everything type of vibe?

335
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:41,703
Mm... 50-50.

336
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,000
Actually, 60-40.
Why is your mom dating this guy?

337
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:48,627
Heather thinks he's hot.

338
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,128
Of course she does.

339
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:52,047
So you're trying to get his password?

340
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,131
Yeah.

341
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,093
Oh, yeah. This will work.

342
00:27:56,176 --> 00:28:00,138
Do you remember that time you impersonated
the Postmates driver on the phone?

343
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:02,307
Dude, he had no idea.

344
00:28:02,391 --> 00:28:04,142
All right. I need your help.

345
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:09,273
<i>So to recover your password,
I'll just have to verify a couple things,</i>

346
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:11,233
<i>starting with date of birth.</i>

347
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:14,278
November 10th, 1980.

348
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:16,864
<i>Great. And the last four of your social.</i>

349
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:20,409
I don't give that out on the phone.

350
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:23,120
<i>Uh, in that case,
your mother's maiden name.</i>

351
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:26,373
Uh... Chen. Julia Chen.

352
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:28,542
<i>And the name of your elementary school.</i>

353
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:32,045
Uh...

354
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:34,423
-The name of my elementary school?
<i>-Yup.</i>

355
00:28:38,886 --> 00:28:42,389
<i>- Uh... sir?
- </i>-Do you need the full name or...?

356
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:44,725
<i>Honestly, whatever works.</i>

357
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:49,062
Uh, Tillman Elementary?

358
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:02,409
Oh, sweet, we're in.

359
00:29:05,454 --> 00:29:08,457
Okay. Let's see where they were going.

360
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:17,257
There's their Uber to LAX.

361
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:19,635
Flight to Cartagena.

362
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:21,428
Hotel.

363
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:23,430
Wait.

364
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:27,017
Maybe he didn't have service?

365
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,769
But he was texting me the whole time.

366
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,981
Unless he turned off his location.

367
00:29:34,775 --> 00:29:37,110
Bad news. The footage is already gone.

368
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:40,030
But interesting story.

369
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:43,283
<i>La señora que limpia</i>,
how do you say, the cleaning <i>señora</i>,

370
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:46,787
she went to school with my son.
And we got to talking--

371
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,539
No, Javi, no time for stories.

372
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:49,748
Hold on.

373
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:52,292
So I explain to her what I'm looking for,

374
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:56,088
and she says she sees
two American tourists leave on Friday.

375
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:58,257
Wait, so she saw them leave.

376
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,092
Now you have time for the story, huh?

377
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:02,845
So they're going to leave,
and your mother says sorry

378
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:06,014
because she spilled some wine
on the bedsheets.

379
00:30:06,098 --> 00:30:07,558
This is like 1 in the afternoon.

380
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:11,937
She dressed up very nice, so the<i> señora
</i>asked if they were going somewhere fancy.

381
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,273
And guess what your stepfather said.

382
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:16,066
Ew, no, not my stepfather.

383
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:18,944
Oh, all right.
But he says he wants to go to...

384
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:24,366
how do you say, you know,
store where shovels and hammers--

385
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:25,659
Wait, a hardware store?

386
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:27,160
<i>Sí,</i> hardware store.

387
00:30:27,244 --> 00:30:28,745
On vacation.

388
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:30,789
Did she say what store they went to?

389
00:30:30,873 --> 00:30:32,708
Uh, no, she didn't ask.

390
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:35,419
There's gotta be a way to figure it out.

391
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:36,336
Yo.

392
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:38,380
<i>Me llamo Veena.</i>

393
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:41,633
<i>Hola. Mucho gusto. Javi.</i>

394
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:44,595
Credit card history.

395
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:48,182
His purchases should have
a location attached to them.

396
00:30:57,941 --> 00:30:59,985
Boom. Kevin's last purchase.

397
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:02,029
Same day they went missing.

398
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:04,740
Getsemani. That's the store.

399
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:07,910
No. Getsemani. That's not a store.

400
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,706
That's an area, <i>muy turístico,
</i>where you go to pay too much for drinks.

401
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:18,795
Okay, well, I'm sending you
all the hardware stores in Getsemani.

402
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:21,381
Talk to the workers,
see if they saw anything, okay?

403
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:23,675
Or maybe I just buy some gum.

404
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,137
-Huh?
-To see if the bank code matches. Eh?

405
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:32,351
Oh, my God. Yes, Javi. Yes.
Okay, I'm sending you the code now.

406
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:36,522
June, eight stores might take a few hours.
Is that okay with you?

407
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:38,357
For now.

408
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,902
I'll look through his emails too,
see if there's a receipt in there.

409
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:43,111
Okay.

410
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:45,572
Here we go, then.

411
00:31:45,656 --> 00:31:49,368
<i>You're going through his email?</i>

412
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:50,494
Yeah, so?

413
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:53,789
So you can't break into Kevin's email
without permission.

414
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:57,042
But why would he turn off his locations?
That doesn't make sense.

415
00:31:57,125 --> 00:32:00,838
I don't know, but you need
to let the police handle this stuff.

416
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:06,009
Um, are you coming over?

417
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:09,805
I'm sorry. I gotta go into the office.
I had to change a client meeting.

418
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:11,431
But I'll be there.

419
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:16,728
-Whoa.
-What? What is it?

420
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:21,275
Um, sorry, Heather, I gotta go.

421
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:25,195
No match yet. Six more to go.

422
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,405
Wait, wait, hold up.

423
00:32:27,573 --> 00:32:30,742
I-- I think Kevin was cheating.

424
00:32:30,826 --> 00:32:32,119
"Sheeting"?

425
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:34,121
He clearly has a type.

426
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,709
What if you checked his blocked users?

427
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:39,835
His what?

428
00:32:39,918 --> 00:32:43,172
In his contacts. Remember that one
<i>Unfiction </i>episode with the affair?

429
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,846
Whoa.

430
00:32:52,598 --> 00:32:54,600
Who are these people?

431
00:32:58,312 --> 00:32:59,438
What the hell?

432
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:01,398
Wait. Who's Greg?

433
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:03,692
Hey, what's going on?

434
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:10,657
This woman calls him Darren.

435
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:21,293
They all want their money back.

436
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:45,067
Yo. Dude's not cheating. He's a...

437
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,194
He's a con man.

438
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:51,782
<i>Three years in Eastham Federal Prison.</i>

439
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:53,200
<i>Released last year.</i>

440
00:33:53,283 --> 00:33:56,370
<i>So you weren't gonna tell me
my mom was dating a felon?</i>

441
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:59,623
<i>Look, don't get me wrong.
We are looking into him.</i>

442
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:01,708
<i>But he's never been involved
in a disappearance.</i>

443
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:03,836
<i>And he's been using his legal name.</i>

444
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,922
But don't you think
this is a pretty big coincidence?

445
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:08,297
<i>Keep in mind</i>

446
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:10,759
<i>that all of these cases
were from before his prison sentence.</i>

447
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:12,427
<i>And he's never violated parole.</i>

448
00:34:12,511 --> 00:34:13,679
Okay.

449
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:16,974
But what about that Bunny Cake girl?
That's from this year.

450
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:20,726
<i>I understand, but right now you are
illegally accessing Mr. Lin's account.</i>

451
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:23,897
<i>So any evidence that I receive from that
gets tossed in court.</i>

452
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:26,775
<i>Look, I appreciate the help.</i>

453
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:31,237
<i>But our job is to find your mom and build
a prosecutable case if there's a crime.</i>

454
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:33,282
<i>So we gotta do this the right way.</i>

455
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:35,868
<i>You need to trust me on this.</i>

456
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:54,511
<i>Uh,</i> yeah, she works here.

457
00:34:54,594 --> 00:34:56,304
And you haven't heard from her at all?

458
00:34:56,388 --> 00:34:58,724
<i>Nope. I've tried calling, DMing her.</i>

459
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:02,394
<i>I've been stuck covering her shift
for the last two weeks, so...</i>

460
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:03,478
Two weeks.

461
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:06,690
<i>Not exactly out of character, though.
She's... special.</i>

462
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:09,735
Do you mind calling if you hear from her?
It's important.

463
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:11,653
<i>Uh... sure.</i>

464
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:15,949
Bunny Cake is missing too.
She hasn't been to work in two weeks.

465
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:17,618
You think he did something to her?

466
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:18,619
I don't know.

467
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:21,788
But I know how to find out.

468
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:24,499
I thought he turned his location off.

469
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:26,335
Not till they got to Colombia.

470
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:29,338
Whoa.

471
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:32,299
He was seeing her.

472
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:36,136
What were you up to?

473
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,184
Huh.

474
00:35:46,438 --> 00:35:47,773
What the hell?

475
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:04,581
<i>And you got this number how?</i>

476
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:08,752
I'm calling about Kevin Lin.
He visited your house like two weeks ago.

477
00:36:08,836 --> 00:36:10,796
<i>Wait, slow down. Kevin?</i>

478
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:13,841
Kevin Lin. He was at your house...

479
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:17,094
June 8th. What was he doing there?

480
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:20,097
<i>Look, I don't wanna say anything
that he doesn't want public.</i>

481
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,224
Oh, so you're trying to cover for him?

482
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:24,434
<i>Covering for wha--? Of course not.</i>

483
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:27,396
Then why was he at your house?

484
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:33,402
<i>It's a reentry program for ex-offenders.</i>

485
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:36,405
<i>I was paired with Kevin
before I moved out here.</i>

486
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:38,073
<i>He comes and visits sometimes.</i>

487
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:43,328
<i>Look, the hardest part for these guys
is getting past the stigma,</i>

488
00:36:43,412 --> 00:36:45,205
<i>so I try to be careful.</i>

489
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:47,124
Yeah, totally.

490
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:48,667
And did he ever...

491
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:52,671
mention my mom anytime?

492
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:54,131
<i>Mention?</i>

493
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:57,259
<i>I mean, he hasn't shut up about her
since they first met.</i>

494
00:36:57,843 --> 00:36:59,887
<i>She seemed really good for him.</i>

495
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:03,849
Yeah. Um, do you remember how they met?

496
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:06,101
<i>I mean, you'd know better than me.</i>

497
00:37:07,311 --> 00:37:08,312
Yeah.

498
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:13,609
Um, you don't think this was
just another one of his, you know...

499
00:37:13,692 --> 00:37:15,819
<i>Oh, no. I mean, look.</i>

500
00:37:15,903 --> 00:37:19,156
<i>Kevin's worked really hard
to put that stuff behind him.</i>

501
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:21,325
<i>It seemed real to me.</i>

502
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:22,451
Yeah.

503
00:37:23,994 --> 00:37:25,954
Um, and you said your name was Jim?

504
00:37:26,038 --> 00:37:27,039
<i>Jimmy, yeah.</i>

505
00:37:27,623 --> 00:37:31,210
<i>Listen, I'll talk to the wife.
I'll, uh, see if she remembers anything.</i>

506
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:33,170
<i>Good luck, June.</i>

507
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:35,255
Okay. Thanks, Jimmy.

508
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:48,852
<i>Is this the store?</i>

509
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:51,730
Do you know how many packs of gum
I bought today?

510
00:37:51,813 --> 00:37:53,440
Did anyone see them?

511
00:37:53,524 --> 00:37:55,275
No one remembers.

512
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,361
But I got the receipt.

513
00:37:57,444 --> 00:38:00,656
Wait, you got it? What did he buy?

514
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:03,242
Just this.

515
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:05,869
A lock?

516
00:38:06,328 --> 00:38:08,288
Why would he buy a lock?

517
00:38:08,372 --> 00:38:10,582
And what about security cameras?

518
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:12,501
No.

519
00:38:18,757 --> 00:38:20,133
So, what's next?

520
00:38:20,217 --> 00:38:24,471
Hey. I gotta bounce.
I'll see you tomorrow, though.

521
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:27,599
Oh. Okay. Yeah, sounds good.

522
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:30,894
Uh,<i> hasta luego, </i>Javi.

523
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:32,646
<i>Adiós, Veena.</i>

524
00:38:36,817 --> 00:38:39,111
I hope I didn't waste your money.

525
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:40,696
No. No, Javi.

526
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:43,198
You've been really helpful.

527
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:47,661
Maybe you should tell <i>la policía
</i>about the lock.

528
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:49,746
They maybe know something.

529
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,039
Sure thing.

530
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:52,749
Peace, Javi.

531
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:54,877
Piece of what?

532
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:58,589
-No, like peace.
-Ah.

533
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:00,632
Just means goodbye.

534
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:04,428
Text if you need anything.

535
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:55,581
Hey, Grace!

536
00:40:57,749 --> 00:41:00,043
Sorry, I didn't mean to say it that loud.

537
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:00,961
Um...

538
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:02,838
Uh, Kevin here.

539
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:06,383
And I thought
I'd just try to get things started.

540
00:41:06,466 --> 00:41:07,301
Um...

541
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:10,179
What's your favorite '80s band?

542
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:23,817
I know, a third message is lame.

543
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:28,488
But you seem great,
and I'd love to know more about you.

544
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:30,824
Also, hello.

545
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:32,576
I forgot that. Okay.

546
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:41,502
I certainly admire your persistence.
So, what would you like to know?

547
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:51,637
Believe it or not, back in the day,
I used to be a huge fan of...

548
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:54,389
New Edition.

549
00:41:54,473 --> 00:41:56,225
Okay.

550
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:58,810
You totally stole my answer.

551
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:11,990
I'm kind of a social media guy cliché.

552
00:42:12,074 --> 00:42:14,201
Shared office space.

553
00:42:14,785 --> 00:42:16,828
There's beer on tap.

554
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:20,958
I don't drink anymore, though, really.
Guess I'm gettin' old.

555
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:24,962
<i>Hi.</i>

556
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:26,797
I'm just getting home.

557
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:29,049
Another 13-hour day.

558
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:31,718
You know what, Grace?
It sounds like you need a vacation.

559
00:42:31,802 --> 00:42:35,055
Just get off the grid, do a hard reset.

560
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:37,558
That's what works for me.

561
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:40,394
Hey, Siri, can we take a vac--?
Oh, crap.

562
00:42:40,477 --> 00:42:43,313
"Hey, Siri, can we take a vaca--?"

563
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:49,194
Hey, Siri, remind me
to ask Grace out to dinner. Uh...

564
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:50,904
Wait...

565
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:52,614
Is this recording?

566
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,118
Guess what this song is called.

567
00:42:56,201 --> 00:42:57,452
Last night was fun.

568
00:43:09,256 --> 00:43:10,716
I just don't know what to do.

569
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:13,427
I tried to leave a voicemail.
Her voicemail is full.

570
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:16,263
She turned off location services.

571
00:43:16,346 --> 00:43:20,017
And she knows that
she's supposed to be home at 11.

572
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,393
She knows this.

573
00:43:21,476 --> 00:43:22,477
<i>Hey.</i>

574
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:24,271
She's almost 18.

575
00:43:25,856 --> 00:43:29,610
If she took the time
to turn off locations,

576
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:31,445
she's probably okay.

577
00:43:31,528 --> 00:43:32,738
<i>I know, I just...</i>

578
00:43:33,363 --> 00:43:34,781
I don't know. She--

579
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:37,534
When I look at her, I just...

580
00:43:38,076 --> 00:43:40,746
I just see her father, and it's like...

581
00:43:46,502 --> 00:43:49,546
We've really been through a lot together.

582
00:43:53,425 --> 00:43:56,220
And I just don't think that I could, uh...

583
00:43:59,223 --> 00:44:01,099
I don't think that I could forgive myself

584
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:03,727
if anything ever happened to her,
you know?

585
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:06,647
You seem like a really great mom.

586
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,274
One day,

587
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:11,443
she'll get that.

588
00:44:39,388 --> 00:44:42,516
Uh... so actually, I've got stuff too.

589
00:44:46,186 --> 00:44:47,688
I have a record.

590
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:52,192
And I shoulda told you earlier.

591
00:44:52,276 --> 00:44:54,778
But I just really...

592
00:44:55,946 --> 00:45:00,200
I really like you,
and I just didn't wanna screw this up.

593
00:45:00,868 --> 00:45:05,372
But if you don't wanna, uh, keep talking,

594
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:06,874
I totally get it.

595
00:45:06,957 --> 00:45:07,958
Um...

596
00:45:10,544 --> 00:45:11,628
So...

597
00:45:11,712 --> 00:45:12,921
So yeah.

598
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:33,210
<i>"G-A, K-L."</i>

599
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:34,127
<i>¿Sí?</i>

600
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,921
Yeah.

601
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:38,340
There it is.

602
00:46:40,759 --> 00:46:42,052
There it is.

603
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:44,721
I should have thought of this place.

604
00:46:44,805 --> 00:46:47,516
Lots of tourists. And good for couples.

605
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:53,647
Hold on a sec.

606
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:03,031
There.

607
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:10,205
Javi, can you wave for me?

608
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:11,373
<i>¿Qué?</i>

609
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:12,499
Wave.

610
00:47:16,128 --> 00:47:17,379
I see you.

611
00:47:17,462 --> 00:47:19,256
Hey, June!

612
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:21,717
Okay, let me check the archive.

613
00:47:32,436 --> 00:47:34,438
Come on, come on, come on.

614
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:36,690
Wait.

615
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:38,442
There!

616
00:47:40,068 --> 00:47:41,195
Do you see them?

617
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:44,740
Yeah.

618
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,079
He has the lock.

619
00:47:57,044 --> 00:47:58,337
Wait.

620
00:47:59,046 --> 00:48:01,465
Wait, he's pulling something
out of his pocket.

621
00:48:11,558 --> 00:48:12,851
What?

622
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:26,782
It was real.

623
00:48:31,245 --> 00:48:32,704
Is everything all right?

624
00:48:34,122 --> 00:48:35,749
Um, yeah. Let me call you back.

625
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:39,044
<i>Ms. Allen? We may have found them.</i>

626
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:41,255
I know they were at the bridge.
You were right.

627
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:42,548
He wasn't trying to con her.

628
00:48:42,631 --> 00:48:44,550
<i>-Ms. Allen.
</i>-Yeah?

629
00:48:45,592 --> 00:48:46,760
<i>Listen.</i>

630
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:48,846
<i>We've got some bad news.</i>

631
00:49:00,649 --> 00:49:01,859
Oh, my God.

632
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:07,573
Who are these people?

633
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:08,866
<i>We don't know.</i>

634
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:12,035
<i>We just received this this morning
from an anonymous source.</i>

635
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:14,997
<i>We're mobilizing units
across the city as we speak.</i>

636
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,291
What are they gonna do to her?

637
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:19,293
<i>Well, we flagged a withdrawal</i>

638
00:49:19,376 --> 00:49:21,795
<i>from your mom's bank
to an encrypted third-party account,</i>

639
00:49:21,879 --> 00:49:23,630
<i>so they may just want money.</i>

640
00:49:23,714 --> 00:49:26,300
So, what now?
Is there anything I can do?

641
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:29,261
<i>Hey, we're gonna find these guys, okay?</i>

642
00:49:29,344 --> 00:49:32,598
<i>The best thing you can do to help us
is just wait by your phone.</i>

643
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:33,974
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

644
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:38,770
They said something about money,
but what if these people hurt her?

645
00:49:38,854 --> 00:49:39,938
They have no reason to.

646
00:49:40,022 --> 00:49:43,567
I've already lost one parent, Javi.
I can't lose her too.

647
00:49:46,528 --> 00:49:48,363
I didn't even say goodbye.

648
00:49:56,455 --> 00:49:58,498
When did you lose your father?

649
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:02,836
I'm sorry
if you don't wanna talk about it.

650
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,838
No, it's fine. Um...

651
00:50:05,631 --> 00:50:07,633
It was years ago.

652
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:11,345
I can't even remember the funeral.

653
00:50:13,805 --> 00:50:17,893
My son Carlos lost his mom
when he was very young too.

654
00:50:17,976 --> 00:50:19,520
That's why I ask.

655
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:21,897
I know it's hard.

656
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,148
Yeah.

657
00:50:23,232 --> 00:50:25,734
Your son is lucky he still has you, Javi.

658
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,194
Hm.

659
00:50:28,445 --> 00:50:29,655
I don't know.

660
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:32,699
What do you mean?

661
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:35,786
He was always trouble.

662
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:39,706
But the trouble got worse,
then one day we had this big fight and...

663
00:50:42,918 --> 00:50:45,754
He said he never wanted
to talk to me again.

664
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:48,173
I guess he meant it.

665
00:50:50,926 --> 00:50:53,929
But, you know,
even if he doesn't want to see me,

666
00:50:54,012 --> 00:50:55,556
he's always <i>mi Carlito</i>.

667
00:50:56,682 --> 00:51:00,727
And whatever you are
beating yourself over with your mom...

668
00:51:02,729 --> 00:51:04,523
it doesn't change a parent's love.

669
00:51:04,606 --> 00:51:05,691
I know.

670
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:10,153
Have you tried reaching out?

671
00:51:11,446 --> 00:51:12,739
To your son?

672
00:51:17,578 --> 00:51:19,121
He knows where I am.

673
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:26,086
Well, anyway, um...

674
00:51:28,589 --> 00:51:31,175
I don't wanna take
any more of your time, Javi.

675
00:51:31,925 --> 00:51:33,760
-Thank you.
-It's no problem, June.

676
00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:35,679
Call anytime.

677
00:51:35,762 --> 00:51:38,056
And, listen, they're gonna find her.

678
00:51:38,891 --> 00:51:39,892
I know.

679
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:42,978
Peace, <i>amiga</i>. Hm?

680
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:46,023
Peace.

681
00:53:49,146 --> 00:53:50,439
Oh, my God.

682
00:54:15,255 --> 00:54:16,423
Good morning.

683
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:19,384
I'm Elijah Park with the FBI.

684
00:54:20,594 --> 00:54:24,723
Last evening we determined
that U.S. citizen Grace Allen,

685
00:54:24,806 --> 00:54:28,519
previously thought to have been kidnapped
here in Cartagena, Colombia,

686
00:54:28,602 --> 00:54:33,982
was in fact impersonated in an
alleged scheme by the suspects behind me.

687
00:54:34,566 --> 00:54:38,070
We are now turning to the public
for any information

688
00:54:38,612 --> 00:54:42,991
regarding the whereabouts of Miss Allen,
who we now believe...

689
00:54:44,326 --> 00:54:45,536
never left Los Angeles.

690
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:52,626
Hi, everybody, first up this morning:
"The strangest case I've ever seen."

691
00:54:52,709 --> 00:54:56,296
Those are the words used
by LAPD Detective Luciana Gomez

692
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:59,049
to describe the disappearance
of a Van Nuys resident

693
00:54:59,132 --> 00:55:01,260
<i>who was seemingly swapped out</i>

694
00:55:01,343 --> 00:55:04,012
<i>with another woman
along their Uber drive to LAX.</i>

695
00:55:04,596 --> 00:55:08,058
<i>Because of the staged kidnapping,
we've lost a lot of time.</i>

696
00:55:08,767 --> 00:55:13,105
It's now been over a week since Miss Allen
was last seen, so we need to move quickly.

697
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:18,193
<i>A ground search begins today
for a woman police say went missing</i>

698
00:55:18,277 --> 00:55:22,281
<i>somewhere along
her nearly 22-mile trip to the airport.</i>

699
00:55:22,364 --> 00:55:24,116
Grace!

700
00:55:28,871 --> 00:55:29,872
Grace!

701
00:55:34,251 --> 00:55:36,420
They were talking to you for a while.
They know anything?

702
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:39,756
They think whatever happened
must have been on the drive to LAX.

703
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,259
Right, right, right.
Look at this. Look at 'em.

704
00:55:44,136 --> 00:55:47,764
<i>So your mom gets in the Uber,
they take the 405,</i>

705
00:55:47,848 --> 00:55:50,475
<i>and then a totally different woman
gets out at LAX.</i>

706
00:55:51,268 --> 00:55:54,771
If Kevin did something to her,
that's when it happened.

707
00:55:54,855 --> 00:55:58,942
The weird thing is, he only ever stopped
for three minutes along the way.

708
00:56:00,402 --> 00:56:01,987
He must have had help.

709
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:06,658
Uber has no record of the trip,
and the car was using stolen plates.

710
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:09,119
We got an APB out for the vehicle now.

711
00:56:09,203 --> 00:56:10,495
Yep. Down in front.

712
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:13,165
Is it possible
that the Uber driver was hired?

713
00:56:13,248 --> 00:56:14,333
It's possible.

714
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:16,585
According to our friends at the FBI...

715
00:56:16,668 --> 00:56:19,963
Large withdrawals from Miss Allen's bank
account were made after her disappearance.

716
00:56:20,047 --> 00:56:23,842
In the meantime, the one person
who knows for sure what's going on here...

717
00:56:23,926 --> 00:56:25,427
Is Mr. Lin.

718
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:27,888
So we're working with the police
around the region,

719
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:30,265
including officers
at the Venezuelan border.

720
00:56:30,974 --> 00:56:32,017
We find him...

721
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,478
And we find Grace Allen.

722
00:56:37,231 --> 00:56:38,857
Whoa. Javi, what are they saying?

723
00:56:38,941 --> 00:56:42,736
They say that the police
arrested some local students

724
00:56:42,819 --> 00:56:46,406
that Lin hired to be part of a movie.

725
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:55,999
-Whoa. June, check this out.
-Huh?

726
00:56:58,335 --> 00:57:00,462
They're arresting her. Right now.

727
00:57:00,546 --> 00:57:02,506
There she is. There, there.

728
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:04,508
No, no, no. Can you see her?

729
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:05,717
What?

730
00:57:07,553 --> 00:57:12,182
Aspiring actress Rachel Page, recently
detained upon reentering the U.S.,

731
00:57:12,266 --> 00:57:15,769
was released today on bail
as a cooperating witness.

732
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,772
<i>He said it was a reality show.</i>

733
00:57:19,773 --> 00:57:22,693
Like a lifestyle travel thing,

734
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:25,237
all shot on a iPhone and stuff.

735
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:28,615
I had to walk a certain way,
dress a certain way.

736
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:31,410
And I couldn't even
post anything on Instagram.

737
00:57:33,745 --> 00:57:36,999
But after the kidnapping scene,

738
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:39,793
I knew something was up.

739
00:57:39,877 --> 00:57:41,545
So I made a run for it.

740
00:57:41,628 --> 00:57:45,048
But there was no crew, no real cameras.

741
00:57:45,132 --> 00:57:47,176
None of that seemed odd?

742
00:57:47,259 --> 00:57:48,343
I just thought:

743
00:57:49,011 --> 00:57:52,097
"Damn. This guy has a vision."

744
00:57:53,056 --> 00:57:55,475
How do you know she's not lying?

745
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:58,687
Miss Page said Kevin and his driver
picked her up near the 405,

746
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:00,814
so LAPD checked traffic cameras.

747
00:58:01,398 --> 00:58:04,151
By the time Kevin got there,
your mom was already gone.

748
00:58:04,234 --> 00:58:05,694
Miss Page never saw her.

749
00:58:05,777 --> 00:58:08,572
Okay, well, did she get
a good look at the driver?

750
00:58:08,655 --> 00:58:11,074
Middle-aged, baseball hat,
that's all we got.

751
00:58:12,242 --> 00:58:14,494
She couldn't see his face
from the back seat.

752
00:58:14,578 --> 00:58:16,538
Yo, Kevin for sure hired that guy.

753
00:58:16,622 --> 00:58:18,207
Veena, shut up.

754
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:19,583
I'm sorry.

755
00:58:19,666 --> 00:58:21,376
Listen, Miss Allen, while I have you,

756
00:58:21,919 --> 00:58:24,713
I have some questions
regarding something we're looking into.

757
00:58:24,796 --> 00:58:26,089
Okay.

758
00:58:26,173 --> 00:58:28,800
You mentioned that you don't have
any extended family, right?

759
00:58:28,884 --> 00:58:29,718
No.

760
00:58:30,302 --> 00:58:31,762
To the best of your knowledge,

761
00:58:31,845 --> 00:58:33,972
your mom has never
gone by any other names?

762
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:37,476
No. She's just Grace Allen. Why?

763
00:58:41,104 --> 00:58:44,900
Exclusive developments tonight
in the case of Grace Allen:

764
00:58:44,983 --> 00:58:49,279
Public records suggesting there may
be more to the missing Van Nuys resident

765
00:58:49,363 --> 00:58:50,572
than meets the eye.

766
00:58:50,656 --> 00:58:55,702
Turns out Grace Allen is just
one of the mystery woman's aliases,

767
00:58:55,786 --> 00:58:59,957
<i>whose real identity lies locked
behind a court-ordered seal.</i>

768
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,917
You're her lawyer.
There's nothing you can do?

769
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,336
It's a court-ordered seal.

770
00:59:04,419 --> 00:59:07,548
It's gonna take at least a week
to get a judge to lift it.

771
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:10,717
And she never said
anything to you about this?

772
00:59:10,801 --> 00:59:12,010
I don't...

773
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:14,680
No, I don't think so.

774
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:18,892
Why would she keep this from me?

775
00:59:20,143 --> 00:59:23,105
Does this suggest Grace Allen
herself might be implicated?

776
00:59:23,188 --> 00:59:24,523
Let me be clear:

777
00:59:24,606 --> 00:59:27,442
Right now, Grace Allen is not a suspect.

778
00:59:28,193 --> 00:59:29,403
That being said,

779
00:59:29,486 --> 00:59:30,904
we can't rule anything out.

780
00:59:35,701 --> 00:59:37,160
<i>Hi, is this June Allen?</i>

781
00:59:37,244 --> 00:59:39,454
<i>I'm an executive at Netflix,
and we'd love to talk to you.</i>

782
00:59:39,538 --> 00:59:41,456
<i>...calling in for my podcast on Spotify--</i>

783
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:44,001
<i>I tried leaving a voicemail.
I'm writing an article--</i>

784
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:46,795
<i>Yo, it's Angel.
Just checking in on things with your mom.</i>

785
00:59:46,879 --> 00:59:49,631
<i>Also, did you find my watch?</i>

786
00:59:49,715 --> 00:59:51,842
<i>So the missing money wasn't stolen.</i>

787
00:59:51,925 --> 00:59:54,553
<i>It was payment to Kevin
for helping her disappear.</i>

788
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:55,637
<i>Why else would she--</i>

789
00:59:55,721 --> 00:59:59,516
She hired Lin and the driver,
stages the kidnapping,

790
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,144
hides in the trunk, drives off,
starts a new life somewhere.

791
01:00:02,227 --> 01:00:04,271
Which we know she's done once before.

792
01:00:04,354 --> 01:00:07,941
I mean, zero known family members,
other than the daughter?

793
01:00:08,025 --> 01:00:09,651
That's hella sus.

794
01:00:11,445 --> 01:00:14,031
I cannot take this anymore!

795
01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:15,449
It's just the Internet, June.

796
01:00:15,532 --> 01:00:19,036
No, no, it's not just the Internet.
It's the police too.

797
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:21,872
Hey, hey, hey.
It's going to be okay, June.

798
01:00:21,955 --> 01:00:24,208
Don't let them put you down.

799
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:40,974
How many tax dollars have been wasted

800
01:00:41,058 --> 01:00:43,060
searching for someone
who clearly ran away?

801
01:00:43,143 --> 01:00:47,606
I mean, her coworker described her
as dodgy and guarded about her past.

802
01:00:47,689 --> 01:00:51,485
How can people believe any of this?
They're focusing on the wrong person.

803
01:00:51,568 --> 01:00:53,737
At least they're trying to help.

804
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:56,240
Like, imagine if this
was an <i>Unfiction </i>episode.

805
01:00:56,323 --> 01:00:59,076
You'd be asking questions too, no?

806
01:00:59,952 --> 01:01:02,412
About Kevin. Not my mom.

807
01:01:02,496 --> 01:01:05,249
Yeah, but even you said
she was hiding something, right?

808
01:01:05,332 --> 01:01:08,836
She knew about Kevin the whole time.
Plus the whole identity change--

809
01:01:08,919 --> 01:01:10,420
Veena, what the hell?

810
01:01:11,713 --> 01:01:14,383
No, I just mean that
there are some legit questions.

811
01:01:14,466 --> 01:01:16,593
There are no questions!

812
01:01:16,677 --> 01:01:19,638
This is not a show, this is my mom!

813
01:01:19,721 --> 01:01:21,473
June, obviously I--

814
01:01:21,557 --> 01:01:22,891
You should just go.

815
01:05:15,832 --> 01:05:18,210
She was messaging Kevin
less than 24 hours ago.

816
01:05:18,293 --> 01:05:20,295
Plus she's been ignoring me
since they went missing.

817
01:05:20,379 --> 01:05:23,674
Breathe. Just breathe.
Maybe there is a good answer.

818
01:05:23,757 --> 01:05:26,051
And she's been obsessed with Kevin
ever since they met.

819
01:05:26,134 --> 01:05:27,761
It's all making sense.

820
01:05:28,262 --> 01:05:29,888
-What is that?
-It has a camera.

821
01:05:29,972 --> 01:05:31,557
This way, she won't know I'm recording.

822
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:35,644
June, if you think something is wrong,
you need to tell <i>la policía.</i>

823
01:05:35,727 --> 01:05:40,107
I have tried! I have tried telling them
about Kevin and about Rachel.

824
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:43,026
But anything I find
on Kevin's account can't be used

825
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:46,196
to help "build a prosecutable case"
or whatever,

826
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,614
so I have to record her.

827
01:05:47,698 --> 01:05:49,241
I'm syncing to the watch now.

828
01:05:49,324 --> 01:05:53,412
I need you to stay on the phone while
I'm in there in case something happens.

829
01:05:53,495 --> 01:05:54,663
<i>June, I'm sorry.</i>

830
01:05:54,746 --> 01:05:56,081
<i>It's too dangerous.</i>

831
01:05:56,164 --> 01:06:00,043
No, the police are acting like
my mom's some kind of criminal mastermind.

832
01:06:00,127 --> 01:06:04,381
<i>Pero</i> maybe right now
you need to trust them.

833
01:06:05,716 --> 01:06:07,593
What are you saying?

834
01:06:07,676 --> 01:06:09,553
Just because someone is your parent,

835
01:06:09,636 --> 01:06:12,306
it doesn't mean they do not make mistakes.

836
01:06:12,389 --> 01:06:13,390
Oh.

837
01:06:14,933 --> 01:06:16,768
I guess you would know, huh?

838
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,772
Maybe you gave up on your son...

839
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:23,609
but I'm not giving up on my mom.

840
01:06:46,423 --> 01:06:48,425
It's June 27th, 10 p.m.,

841
01:06:48,509 --> 01:06:53,013
at the office of Heather Damore,
73815 Wilshire Boulevard.

842
01:07:07,778 --> 01:07:09,696
Approaching her office now.

843
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,540
Heather?

844
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:22,000
Heather, it's June!

845
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:26,129
Heather, I saw your car out there.
I know you're--

846
01:07:33,178 --> 01:07:34,263
Hello?

847
01:07:55,659 --> 01:07:56,910
The hell?

848
01:08:18,055 --> 01:08:19,140
What?

849
01:08:55,093 --> 01:08:56,553
Hello?

850
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,727
Heather?

851
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:06,939
Oh, my God.

852
01:09:11,401 --> 01:09:12,444
Oh, my God.

853
01:09:12,528 --> 01:09:13,737
Oh, my God! Heather!

854
01:09:26,416 --> 01:09:27,917
Based on the autopsy,

855
01:09:28,001 --> 01:09:30,837
whoever did this
was there minutes before you arrived.

856
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:34,800
You're lucky to be alive.

857
01:09:38,095 --> 01:09:41,305
They must've seen
the messages I sent to her.

858
01:09:42,515 --> 01:09:44,184
They knew I was coming.

859
01:09:48,522 --> 01:09:52,149
I just don't understand
why she'd be messaging him.

860
01:09:52,818 --> 01:09:55,529
Look, the wiped computer,
the missing files...

861
01:09:56,321 --> 01:09:59,783
My guess is that she knew something
that Kevin didn't want us to know.

862
01:10:01,285 --> 01:10:03,453
She wasn't willfully messaging him.

863
01:10:04,913 --> 01:10:06,623
He was threatening her.

864
01:10:06,707 --> 01:10:08,500
And the photos were...?

865
01:10:08,584 --> 01:10:10,711
To keep her quiet. Yeah.

866
01:10:15,716 --> 01:10:18,177
She was trying to protect me.

867
01:10:20,929 --> 01:10:24,725
But if Kevin is still in Colombia,
who did this?

868
01:10:24,808 --> 01:10:26,101
I don't know.

869
01:10:26,185 --> 01:10:28,854
But in the meantime,
LAPD will stay there with you

870
01:10:28,937 --> 01:10:31,732
until they find a safe place
for you to go. Okay?

871
01:10:33,567 --> 01:10:35,819
Look, Mr. Lin is the key to all of this.

872
01:10:36,486 --> 01:10:39,823
Now, the good news is police
may have spotted him near the border,

873
01:10:39,907 --> 01:10:41,533
so it might not be long.

874
01:10:42,367 --> 01:10:45,037
He is our best chance at finding your mom.

875
01:10:47,706 --> 01:10:48,832
Yeah.

876
01:10:50,792 --> 01:10:52,127
Thank you.

877
01:13:11,308 --> 01:13:12,518
<i>¡Policía!</i>

878
01:13:14,269 --> 01:13:17,064
Okay! Hey! Hold up!

879
01:13:17,147 --> 01:13:18,273
<i>Tranquilo</i>.

880
01:13:19,733 --> 01:13:21,026
<i>No comprendo.</i>

881
01:13:23,487 --> 01:13:24,655
Please!

882
01:16:02,813 --> 01:16:04,606
<i>Hey, sweetheart. It's Mom.</i>

883
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:08,443
<i>Just, um, wondering
if you wanted to catch a movie toni--</i>

884
01:16:13,156 --> 01:16:15,701
<i>Hi, my name is Grace Allen,</i>

885
01:16:15,784 --> 01:16:20,038
<i>and I'm actually your mother, if you could
call me back at your earliest convenience.</i>

886
01:16:20,122 --> 01:16:22,291
<i>Hey, Siri. Call Junie--</i>

887
01:16:22,374 --> 01:16:24,793
<i>Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
I thought this was a--</i>

888
01:16:24,877 --> 01:16:26,003
<i>Never mind.</i>

889
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,213
<i>Hey, Junebug.</i>

890
01:16:28,297 --> 01:16:29,923
<i>It's Mommy.</i>

891
01:16:30,007 --> 01:16:33,510
<i>I tried knocking, uh,
but you didn't answer.</i>

892
01:16:33,594 --> 01:16:35,929
<i>I'm sure you have your headphones on.</i>

893
01:16:37,431 --> 01:16:38,724
<i>Uh...</i>

894
01:16:38,807 --> 01:16:42,769
<i>Look, there's actually a lot
I want to talk with you about.</i>

895
01:16:43,687 --> 01:16:47,733
<i>So anyway, you're probably
not even checking these messages,</i>

896
01:16:47,816 --> 01:16:49,401
<i>but I guess we'll talk later.</i>

897
01:16:50,277 --> 01:16:51,445
<i>I love you.</i>

898
01:16:52,154 --> 01:16:53,155
<i>Bye--</i>

899
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:08,504
<i>Hey, Junebug. It's--</i>

900
01:19:20,886 --> 01:19:22,095
Hello?

901
01:19:27,392 --> 01:19:28,352
Hello?

902
01:20:29,955 --> 01:20:31,206
- Hello?
<i>-  June?</i>

903
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:33,125
<i>Thank God. Are you safe?</i>

904
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:35,169
Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Why?

905
01:20:35,252 --> 01:20:37,129
<i>Are all the doors locked?</i>

906
01:20:37,212 --> 01:20:38,463
Yeah, I think so.

907
01:20:38,547 --> 01:20:41,425
Wait, this is Jimmy
from the church thing?

908
01:20:41,508 --> 01:20:44,469
<i>Look, there's a lot to explain,
but we don't know who's listening.</i>

909
01:20:45,637 --> 01:20:48,307
Okay. Well, should I call someone?

910
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:50,934
<i>No, I don't know
who to trust at this point.</i>

911
01:20:51,018 --> 01:20:53,604
<i>Look, just stay on the phone
with me, okay?</i>

912
01:20:55,731 --> 01:20:59,067
Oh, my God. Someone's here.

913
01:20:59,151 --> 01:21:00,235
<i>It's just me.</i>

914
01:21:00,319 --> 01:21:02,112
Don't worry. It's gonna be okay.

915
01:21:02,196 --> 01:21:03,322
What?

916
01:21:03,405 --> 01:21:05,282
What are you doing here?

917
01:21:05,365 --> 01:21:08,452
I came as soon as I could.
I didn't mean to scare you.

918
01:21:08,535 --> 01:21:12,164
No, you need to tell me what's going on
right now before I call the police!

919
01:21:29,556 --> 01:21:30,557
Listen.

920
01:21:32,476 --> 01:21:34,102
I know this sounds crazy.

921
01:21:35,812 --> 01:21:37,689
<i>I came as soon as I could.</i>

922
01:21:39,358 --> 01:21:41,318
<i>I'm sorry to show up like this...</i>

923
01:21:42,945 --> 01:21:44,530
but there are things...

924
01:21:45,697 --> 01:21:47,783
There are things that you need to know.

925
01:21:52,746 --> 01:21:54,665
<i>I can explain everything.</i>

926
01:22:02,214 --> 01:22:03,215
June?

927
01:22:04,383 --> 01:22:05,592
Are you still there?

928
01:22:10,514 --> 01:22:11,515
June.

929
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:16,395
June?

930
01:22:18,272 --> 01:22:19,773
If you can hear me...

931
01:22:21,233 --> 01:22:22,943
Look, I know this is hard.

932
01:22:24,611 --> 01:22:28,448
But you deserve to know what happened.

933
01:22:31,952 --> 01:22:32,953
Please.

934
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:37,791
June?

935
01:22:48,969 --> 01:22:50,053
Dad.

936
01:22:56,226 --> 01:22:57,311
June.

937
01:22:57,394 --> 01:22:58,729
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

938
01:22:58,812 --> 01:22:59,813
Okay, okay.

939
01:22:59,897 --> 01:23:00,939
Wait.

940
01:23:01,648 --> 01:23:02,649
Okay.

941
01:23:03,358 --> 01:23:04,860
What is going on?

942
01:23:10,782 --> 01:23:11,992
Your mom...

943
01:23:13,785 --> 01:23:15,537
Her real name is Sarah.

944
01:23:16,872 --> 01:23:18,999
And when you were little,

945
01:23:19,082 --> 01:23:20,834
we were always fighting.

946
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:25,923
She barely would let me feed you...

947
01:23:26,006 --> 01:23:27,966
or play with you.

948
01:23:29,885 --> 01:23:33,472
Every day it got worse and worse.

949
01:23:34,848 --> 01:23:36,683
Until she took you away.

950
01:23:38,519 --> 01:23:42,022
And I've been searching for you
ever since.

951
01:23:45,609 --> 01:23:46,652
Hey.

952
01:23:46,735 --> 01:23:48,070
Caesar.

953
01:23:53,408 --> 01:23:55,911
She told me you were dead.

954
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:00,749
June, you don't know
what she's capable of.

955
01:24:02,793 --> 01:24:06,588
She lied to a judge
to have me put in prison

956
01:24:06,672 --> 01:24:09,216
so that she could have you to herself.

957
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:12,177
She lied to me.

958
01:24:14,847 --> 01:24:17,516
Every day for 12 years...

959
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:22,896
I had to wake up in Eastham
knowing that she had you somewhere.

960
01:24:31,196 --> 01:24:33,365
You were in Eastham Prison?

961
01:24:35,534 --> 01:24:36,910
In Texas?

962
01:24:36,994 --> 01:24:37,995
June.

963
01:24:38,996 --> 01:24:41,123
She took everything from me.

964
01:24:43,542 --> 01:24:45,460
But that's where Kevin was.

965
01:24:48,463 --> 01:24:50,507
You weren't his counselor.

966
01:24:52,301 --> 01:24:54,178
You met him in prison.

967
01:24:57,848 --> 01:24:59,016
Sweetheart.

968
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:02,019
Please.

969
01:25:12,487 --> 01:25:13,405
June.

970
01:25:14,114 --> 01:25:15,866
Can we just talk for a minute?

971
01:25:17,242 --> 01:25:18,535
Where is she?

972
01:25:19,286 --> 01:25:20,662
Sweetheart.

973
01:25:22,831 --> 01:25:24,291
-Hey, no! June!
-Help!

974
01:25:24,374 --> 01:25:25,417
No, no, no!

975
01:25:33,884 --> 01:25:35,052
It's okay.

976
01:25:59,576 --> 01:26:02,204
Well, then I'm just gonna
fix it again, aren't I?

977
01:26:02,287 --> 01:26:03,664
What's that?

978
01:26:04,456 --> 01:26:06,875
- James.
- It's just the altitude. I'm fine.

979
01:26:06,959 --> 01:26:08,293
James, are you okay?

980
01:26:08,377 --> 01:26:10,212
No, no, no, no. Daddy's fine.

981
01:26:12,589 --> 01:26:13,674
James.

982
01:26:14,591 --> 01:26:16,426
Are you good?

983
01:26:18,136 --> 01:26:20,097
-Hey, do you wanna play hide-and-seek?
-Mm-hm.

984
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:22,474
You wanna go upstairs? I'll count to 20.

985
01:26:22,558 --> 01:26:25,269
And don't let Daddy find you. Okay?

986
01:26:32,985 --> 01:26:35,946
-Why you gotta do that in front of her?
-Do what?

987
01:26:37,489 --> 01:26:38,866
"Are you good?"

988
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:42,411
What, I can't play
with my own daughter now?

989
01:26:42,494 --> 01:26:44,705
-I didn't say anything.
-Seriously?

990
01:26:45,163 --> 01:26:47,583
It's just that I saw you
go out back and I know--

991
01:26:47,666 --> 01:26:49,042
Are you filming this?

992
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,713
-No, I'm not filming anything.
-Give me the camera.

993
01:27:00,512 --> 01:27:04,308
<i>Sarah, I've been trying to call.
Where are you?</i>

994
01:27:04,391 --> 01:27:06,143
Are you at the house?

995
01:27:06,226 --> 01:27:07,060
<i>Yeah.</i>

996
01:27:09,104 --> 01:27:13,025
<i>Look, how about you and June come back,
and we talk this out.</i>

997
01:27:13,108 --> 01:27:14,318
<i>Okay?</i>

998
01:27:16,278 --> 01:27:18,947
<i>You promised me you would stay clean.</i>

999
01:27:19,031 --> 01:27:21,200
<i>And what, you're saying I haven't?</i>

1000
01:27:23,702 --> 01:27:27,456
<i>You can't just make shit up in order
to steal my daughter from me, Sarah.</i>

1001
01:27:32,836 --> 01:27:35,339
<i>Look, Sare-bear, I'm sorry.</i>

1002
01:27:35,422 --> 01:27:37,090
<i>I didn't mean to get upset.</i>

1003
01:27:38,258 --> 01:27:39,676
<i>It's just--</i>

1004
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,554
<i>It is frustrating
trying to reason with you</i>

1005
01:27:42,638 --> 01:27:45,432
<i>when you won't acknowledge baseline facts.</i>

1006
01:27:52,272 --> 01:27:54,441
<i>Look, I promise I'm clean.</i>

1007
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:59,154
<i>Can you just come home,
so that we can work this out as a family?</i>

1008
01:28:00,405 --> 01:28:01,490
<i>For June's sake?</i>

1009
01:28:08,205 --> 01:28:11,291
<i>Then how do you explain
what I found in the hallway closet?</i>

1010
01:28:11,375 --> 01:28:12,209
<i>What?</i>

1011
01:28:13,752 --> 01:28:15,128
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

1012
01:28:16,588 --> 01:28:18,549
<i>We were playing hide-and-seek.</i>

1013
01:28:19,633 --> 01:28:21,510
<i>And guess what June found.</i>

1014
01:28:21,593 --> 01:28:22,553
<i>Okay, Sarah.</i>

1015
01:28:22,636 --> 01:28:26,139
<i>Yes, I found a way to turn
some stuff over, but it's worth a lot,</i>

1016
01:28:26,223 --> 01:28:30,727
<i>so you need to cut the shit
and tell me what you did with it!</i>

1017
01:28:31,562 --> 01:28:33,146
<i>I left it where it was.</i>

1018
01:28:33,230 --> 01:28:35,190
<i>Police! Open the door!</i>

1019
01:28:35,274 --> 01:28:37,359
<i>Jesus Christ, what did you do?</i>

1020
01:28:37,442 --> 01:28:40,445
I can't let you put our daughter
in danger anymore.

1021
01:28:40,529 --> 01:28:41,947
<i>You need to open the door!</i>

1022
01:28:42,030 --> 01:28:43,824
<i>I swear to God, I will find you,</i>

1023
01:28:43,907 --> 01:28:48,787
<i>and you will die in a pool of your
own blood before you take her from me!</i>

1024
01:28:48,871 --> 01:28:49,872
<i>Do you hear me?!</i>

1025
01:29:41,173 --> 01:29:43,342
<i>I can't imagine
what you must be going through.</i>

1026
01:29:43,425 --> 01:29:44,801
<i>We really hate to see you go.</i>

1027
01:29:44,885 --> 01:29:47,262
<i>I really had no idea
what you were going through.</i>

1028
01:29:47,346 --> 01:29:49,806
<i>I love you.
I'm praying for you and June.</i>

1029
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:52,184
<i> I know you two
will get through this together.</i>

1030
01:29:52,267 --> 01:29:55,437
- <i>We're gonna miss you a lot.
- </i>-<i>Someday she'll understand.</i>

1031
01:29:55,521 --> 01:29:56,396
No!

1032
01:31:08,010 --> 01:31:10,137
No! No!

1033
01:31:17,019 --> 01:31:19,313
Just gotta take care of one thing,
and then we'll leave.

1034
01:32:00,145 --> 01:32:01,188
Shit.

1035
01:32:14,034 --> 01:32:15,494
We're going outside.

1036
01:32:16,537 --> 01:32:18,997
If you were gonna kill me,
you woulda done it already.

1037
01:32:20,874 --> 01:32:22,459
Things have changed.

1038
01:32:30,884 --> 01:32:31,802
June.

1039
01:32:32,469 --> 01:32:35,138
June!

1040
01:32:35,222 --> 01:32:37,307
Twelve years, Sarah.

1041
01:32:37,391 --> 01:32:40,727
Twelve years,
I felt just like you feel right now.

1042
01:32:41,311 --> 01:32:44,273
I wish I could've kept you here. But...

1043
01:32:45,816 --> 01:32:47,359
June and I have to go.

1044
01:32:49,778 --> 01:32:50,779
June!

1045
01:33:16,722 --> 01:33:18,098
Oh, my God. Junie!

1046
01:33:18,682 --> 01:33:21,226
-Mom! Mom? Mom?
-Okay, baby. You're okay.

1047
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:23,604
-Is that really you?
-Baby, I am so sorry.

1048
01:33:24,563 --> 01:33:26,607
I am so sorry.

1049
01:33:34,531 --> 01:33:37,534
We have to get out of here,
do you understand me? He is spiraling.

1050
01:33:37,618 --> 01:33:39,620
-He killed Heather.
-He killed Heather?

1051
01:33:39,703 --> 01:33:43,332
He's crazy. He thinks
he's punishing me for what I did to him.

1052
01:33:44,374 --> 01:33:46,960
Okay. I'm gonna
tell you everything in the car.

1053
01:33:47,044 --> 01:33:48,504
I want you to take the keys--

1054
01:33:48,587 --> 01:33:49,755
No, Mom!

1055
01:33:50,339 --> 01:33:52,341
No! No! No, no, no!

1056
01:33:52,424 --> 01:33:53,634
Oh, my God!

1057
01:33:53,717 --> 01:33:55,052
Oh, God.

1058
01:34:02,935 --> 01:34:04,144
Where is he going?

1059
01:34:04,228 --> 01:34:05,562
The chair.

1060
01:34:16,031 --> 01:34:18,158
-What is he gonna do to us?
-I don't know.

1061
01:34:18,742 --> 01:34:20,869
I don't even know why he brought you here.

1062
01:34:24,748 --> 01:34:26,500
Oh, 'cause he knew.

1063
01:34:26,583 --> 01:34:28,710
He knew I was about to find him.

1064
01:34:34,174 --> 01:34:35,259
Wait.

1065
01:34:44,184 --> 01:34:46,478
Hello? Hello, hello?
Can anyone hear me?

1066
01:34:46,562 --> 01:34:49,857
Okay, June, we have to get out of here
while he's still outside.

1067
01:34:49,940 --> 01:34:50,983
Where's your phone?

1068
01:34:51,066 --> 01:34:54,611
I don't have my phone. It's at the house.
If only I could just...

1069
01:34:58,115 --> 01:34:59,074
Oh, my God.

1070
01:35:00,492 --> 01:35:01,410
What?

1071
01:35:02,494 --> 01:35:03,495
Oh, my God, yes!

1072
01:35:04,371 --> 01:35:06,790
Do you remember
the address to this place?

1073
01:35:06,874 --> 01:35:09,251
I think it was something Mariposa Road?

1074
01:35:09,334 --> 01:35:10,961
But that's all I remember.

1075
01:35:11,044 --> 01:35:13,755
Everything needs
to be paired with a phone.

1076
01:35:13,839 --> 01:35:15,507
- Wait.
- What?

1077
01:35:15,591 --> 01:35:16,633
Unless...

1078
01:35:21,513 --> 01:35:23,932
Okay. I have an idea.

1079
01:35:43,285 --> 01:35:46,997
I need to use the navigation.
Please do not call again. Okay? Bye.

1080
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:49,541
Javi, please! I'm sorry about what I said.

1081
01:35:49,625 --> 01:35:51,710
You did not give up on your son.

1082
01:35:53,045 --> 01:35:56,173
I found my mom,
but we're running out of time.

1083
01:35:56,256 --> 01:35:58,467
Please, I need your help.

1084
01:35:58,967 --> 01:36:00,260
Please.

1085
01:36:03,931 --> 01:36:04,973
What?

1086
01:36:05,057 --> 01:36:07,309
I need you to go to my Instagram
and find a picture.

1087
01:36:07,392 --> 01:36:08,769
I still don't see him.

1088
01:36:08,852 --> 01:36:10,103
<i>Please hurry.</i>

1089
01:36:10,187 --> 01:36:11,772
<i>Sí, sí, momentico.</i>

1090
01:36:11,855 --> 01:36:13,815
What's the account name?

1091
01:36:13,899 --> 01:36:16,193
<i>It's J-U-underscore-U--</i>

1092
01:36:16,276 --> 01:36:18,487
"Underscore"?
<i>¿Qué es eso?</i> What's that?

1093
01:36:18,570 --> 01:36:21,114
<i>It's the little line,
like at the bottom, you know?</i>

1094
01:36:21,198 --> 01:36:22,908
<i>Yeah.</i>

1095
01:36:22,991 --> 01:36:26,662
So it's J-U-underscore-U-N-E-1.

1096
01:36:30,374 --> 01:36:33,961
<i>Okay, I need you to go
to the first picture on my Instagram.</i>

1097
01:36:35,587 --> 01:36:38,590
<i>Great. On the house behind us,
there are numbers. What are they?</i>

1098
01:36:38,674 --> 01:36:42,636
Um... 48541.

1099
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:45,472
<i>Okay, call the police
and tell them we are at 4--</i>

1100
01:36:48,892 --> 01:36:50,102
Oh, no.

1101
01:36:50,185 --> 01:36:51,645
He's coming back.

1102
01:36:54,022 --> 01:36:55,190
Get back.

1103
01:36:59,111 --> 01:37:00,362
What's going on?

1104
01:37:01,989 --> 01:37:03,240
-Give me the watch.
-What--

1105
01:37:03,323 --> 01:37:04,533
Hey!

1106
01:37:04,616 --> 01:37:07,452
I am talking to my daughter.

1107
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:10,956
June, did you just make a call?

1108
01:37:12,666 --> 01:37:16,044
Okay. Now, I need you
to come with me right now.

1109
01:37:16,128 --> 01:37:17,713
Back off.

1110
01:37:18,839 --> 01:37:22,009
-June, come with me, please.
-Leave her alone.

1111
01:37:22,092 --> 01:37:25,345
One more word from you, and you are dead.

1112
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:29,725
June, I'm not gonna ask again.

1113
01:37:29,808 --> 01:37:30,642
Please don't--

1114
01:37:34,563 --> 01:37:35,397
Mom!

1115
01:37:37,149 --> 01:37:38,567
No, no, no!

1116
01:37:39,651 --> 01:37:41,945
Mom!

1117
01:37:42,029 --> 01:37:44,448
What did you do?! No!

1118
01:37:44,531 --> 01:37:46,366
What did you do?

1119
01:37:47,201 --> 01:37:48,368
June--

1120
01:37:48,994 --> 01:37:50,454
Come on. Hey!

1121
01:37:54,041 --> 01:37:55,167
Get off of me!

1122
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:58,295
See? It's okay.

1123
01:37:59,004 --> 01:38:01,715
You're just making this harder.

1124
01:38:19,858 --> 01:38:21,068
Please.

1125
01:38:22,861 --> 01:38:24,571
No, no, no!

1126
01:38:24,655 --> 01:38:27,824
Hey! Hey, let us out! Let us out!

1127
01:38:29,326 --> 01:38:30,744
Mom!

1128
01:38:30,827 --> 01:38:32,496
Mom. Mom.

1129
01:38:32,579 --> 01:38:33,872
No.

1130
01:38:40,087 --> 01:38:43,257
Dad. Dad, please. Please don't do this.

1131
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:47,302
Please, if you can hear me,
just open the door, please!

1132
01:38:47,386 --> 01:38:49,179
She needs help! Please!

1133
01:38:49,263 --> 01:38:52,432
No one has to die.
Just please call for help!

1134
01:38:52,516 --> 01:38:53,517
Anyone!

1135
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:56,728
If anyone can hear me,
I am trapped in a room with my mom!

1136
01:38:56,812 --> 01:39:00,065
We are at 48541 Mariposa Road.

1137
01:39:10,993 --> 01:39:12,077
Anyone.

1138
01:39:14,496 --> 01:39:15,664
Junebug?

1139
01:39:16,748 --> 01:39:17,958
Mom.

1140
01:39:20,085 --> 01:39:22,337
No. Mom, it's okay.

1141
01:39:23,046 --> 01:39:24,506
Oh, my God.

1142
01:39:24,590 --> 01:39:25,757
I'm so sorry.

1143
01:39:25,841 --> 01:39:27,342
No, no, no.

1144
01:39:27,426 --> 01:39:30,679
No, you don't say that.
No. No, you don't say that.

1145
01:39:35,225 --> 01:39:36,810
I'm sorry.

1146
01:39:48,071 --> 01:39:49,489
I promise...

1147
01:39:50,157 --> 01:39:53,994
I promise if we could just get home,
I'll be better.

1148
01:39:55,954 --> 01:39:58,498
I'll start checking my voicemails.

1149
01:40:00,125 --> 01:40:03,420
I'll let you call me Junebug all you want.

1150
01:40:05,881 --> 01:40:11,136
And I'll stop making fun of you
for using Siri for literally everything.

1151
01:40:12,304 --> 01:40:13,555
I just...

1152
01:40:38,789 --> 01:40:40,123
Hey, Siri.

1153
01:40:47,130 --> 01:40:48,757
Call 911.

1154
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:56,014
<i>Distress call at 48541 Mariposa Road.</i>

1155
01:40:56,098 --> 01:40:59,393
<i>Any available units in the vicinity,
report immediately.</i>

1156
01:41:03,438 --> 01:41:04,898
Go, go, go!

1157
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:11,738
- Go, go, go!
- Clear!

1158
01:41:11,822 --> 01:41:13,198
- Go, go, go!
- Clear.

1159
01:41:13,282 --> 01:41:14,533
Check the other side!

1160
01:41:14,616 --> 01:41:15,742
Hallway clear.

1161
01:41:16,326 --> 01:41:17,619
Suspect down!

1162
01:41:18,287 --> 01:41:19,162
Help!

1163
01:41:20,205 --> 01:41:21,748
We need help!

1164
01:41:23,166 --> 01:41:25,252
-SWAT! Let me see your hands!
-Hands up!

1165
01:41:25,335 --> 01:41:26,753
Victim down, victim down!

1166
01:41:26,837 --> 01:41:28,005
Clear!

1167
01:41:28,088 --> 01:41:30,549
Lung's collapsed. We need a transport now.

1168
01:41:30,632 --> 01:41:31,717
Is she okay?

1169
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:34,011
30-Squad to Control,
we have an adult female,

1170
01:41:34,094 --> 01:41:37,139
upper body GSW, requesting airlift.

1171
01:42:23,101 --> 01:42:25,521
Hey, Junebug, it's Mom.
I hope I'm not interrupting--

1172
01:42:25,604 --> 01:42:27,231
-Mom?
-Yeah?

1173
01:42:27,314 --> 01:42:29,608
This is FaceTime.

1174
01:42:29,691 --> 01:42:31,109
Oh, gosh.

1175
01:42:31,193 --> 01:42:32,444
I know, I know.

1176
01:42:32,528 --> 01:42:34,571
-I just put the phone down for a second.
-Mm-hm.

1177
01:42:34,655 --> 01:42:37,741
I just wanted to remind you that
your bus leaves at 8:35 in the morning,

1178
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:39,785
so you might wanna set multiple alarms.

1179
01:42:39,868 --> 01:42:41,161
Yep. Already did.

1180
01:42:41,245 --> 01:42:43,914
I'll also send you some lunch money
if you need any, okay?

1181
01:42:44,915 --> 01:42:45,916
What?

1182
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:47,626
Nothing.

1183
01:42:48,961 --> 01:42:50,295
Just thank you.

1184
01:42:54,216 --> 01:42:55,843
Oh, guess what.

1185
01:42:55,926 --> 01:42:59,304
Your friend Javi friended me on Facebook.

1186
01:42:59,388 --> 01:43:00,931
For real? No way.

1187
01:43:07,271 --> 01:43:11,275
Okay. Well, I guess I'll see you
at Union Station tomorrow afternoon.

1188
01:43:11,358 --> 01:43:12,526
Can't wait.

1189
01:43:13,026 --> 01:43:14,152
Bye.

1190
01:43:15,237 --> 01:43:16,071
Oh, hey--
